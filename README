Pistachio adds case classes and fluent, type-safe pattern matching to Java


Feature not present in Scala case classes or ML datatypes
=====
Pistachio case classes support "case classes evolution" through JDK 8 default methods.
In most languages, if one adds a new case to a case class, all pattern matching statements
should be updated to take the new case into account. But in Pistachio one can simply add
a default body to the new case that probably delegates to the most appropriate pre-existing
case with appropriate parameters.
